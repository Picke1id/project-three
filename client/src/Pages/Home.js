                ITU is committed to cultivating a safe and inclusive campus community characterized by caring
                and respect for others. This promise extends to you whether you are a student, faculty/staff member,
                or visitor. We pride ourselves not only in our inclusiveness, but also in our vibrancy and vitality
                as a campus. School pride is strong on our campus, so strong, some of our students never leave!
                Indeed, we are quite fond of hiring our students and making them life time members of our staff.
                Many of our students become lifetime givers to our institution as well. Beyond the comradery and inclusion,
                however, what really makes ITU one of the most competitive schools in the nation is our state of the art
                facility and academic programming, with some of the brightest minds in the world as students, graduates and faculty.

                            the whole student outside of the classroom is a better model for success. It's important
                            to have an intentional focus that meets the students where they are. Our student-centered
                            approach creates an evolving plan that tackles any barriers that interfere with success.

                            and concepts, rather than using rote memorization of facts and figures. Learners work with
                            each other on projects, where they must collaborate as a group to understand the concepts being
                            presented to them.

                            Research has shown that students learn faster and perform better in smaller classroom environments.
                            A class size less than 20 students often results in increased individual attention, improved student
                            participation, and better communication between the professor and students. Students receive more
                            feedback from peers and expanded opportunities for hands-on learning than those in large classes. The
                            reduced classroom size permits for better assessment of student work and growth.
